This file contains the Code book for the `dataset_byActivityAndSubject.txt` dataset, generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.
The data cleaning and processing tasks performed are taking as input the following external dataset:

##Study design
The original dataset has been retrieved from the following url: `https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip`.
Then it has been extracted and processed.

Check the README.md for futher information concerning how you can prepare the environment needed to run the `run_analysis.R` script. 
The README.md describes also in finer detail the performed data processing tasks, which are summarized hereafter:

1. data (X, y, subject) is loaded from the `UCI HAR Dataset` folder into R data frames
2. train and test datasets are merged, generating total datasets
3. the X dataset is projected on the features of type mean and std, selected by name from the feature list data frame
4. the activity ids defined in the y dataset are replaced by the corresponding labels
5. a complete data set is generated, containing X, activities and subjects
6. this complete data set is grouped by activity and subject, and for each group the mean of each column is emitted
7. the resulting data set is saved to disk, as a space-separated text file 

##Code book
The following excerpt from the `features_info.txt` file in the `UCI HAR Dataset`, describes how the data has been collected.
```
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The data processing tasks performed by `run_analysis.R` on the original dataset produced a result with the following properties:
- the final dataset is an R data frame, persisted as a text space-separated file, named `dataset_byActivityAndSubject.txt`
- the row names are not stored in the file
- the first line of the file contains the column names
- the data consists of 180 observations of 68 variables
- an observation is associated to one of the 30 subjects, indicated with ids from 1 to 30
- the observation took place when the subject was performing a particular activity: WALKING, SITTING, etc...
- some subject have been observed while performing several activities: those cases are mapped as different observations
- for each couple (subject, activity) 33 mean summary values and 33 std summary values, for various variables, are reported
